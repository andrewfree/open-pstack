# Setup pstack

Configure one portable model sheet for the current parent harness. Read [`provider-dispatch.md`](../poteto-mode/references/provider-dispatch.md) before probing or writing anything. Its model matrix, descriptor grammar, and route table are the contract. Choose one requested effort per assigned matrix family. Do not add a second configuration file, a runtime resolver, or a weaker-model fallback.

Claude Code writes `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` and loads it from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with:

```text
@~/.claude/pstack-models.md
```

Codex writes `~/.codex/pstack-models.md`. When `CODEX_HOME` is set, resolve both Codex targets under that directory instead of the `~/.codex` examples here. Codex has no `@` include, so mirror the sheet's exact bytes inside one bounded block in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and retain the sheet as the editable source of truth:

```text
<!-- pstack:models:begin -->
<exact contents of ~/.codex/pstack-models.md>
<!-- pstack:models:end -->
```

## Steps

### 1. Establish the parent

Use the harness and tool surface running this skill: Claude Code or Codex. Environment markers may corroborate that top-level answer, but do not launch a child and ask it to detect where it came from. Record the parent because the same descriptor takes a different route in each harness.

### 2. Load current state

Read the current parent-specific sheet when it exists. Before matrix validation, normalize only the rolling-alias predecessors that earlier pstack releases generated. A provider-qualified Claude model is migratable when its model component starts with `claude-fable-` or `claude-opus-` and the remaining revision contains only digits and hyphens. Replace that component in memory with `fable` or `opus`, preserving the provider, effort, role, and lane order. Record each original and normalized descriptor for the confirmation in step 7. This migration is valid loaded state and does not require a separate operator choice.

Treat the normalized values as current role-to-family assignments. Overlay those rows on the complete first-run role map in step 7. Materialize any missing documented role row from that map on the next successful write. A duplicate role row is inconsistent state; report it and resolve it before probing. A row whose role is not in the step 7 role map, such as `how critics`, is from a retired role. Drop it and list it at confirmation. A bare host-native slug from an older sheet is also invalid because it does not say which provider owns it. A versioned Claude model outside the two migration families remains inconsistent state. If the sheet is missing, use the complete first-run role map and the model matrix's Default effort cells.

Then ask whether to keep these role-to-family assignments or change named roles. Keeping them is the default. Apply only role changes the operator names; never offer a reset of a customized sheet to the first-run assignments. A changed role may use any model-matrix family, `inherit-parent`, or `auto`.

### 3. Parse per-family efforts

Read the model matrix. Every non-alias value must match `<provider>:<model>@<effort>`. Map it to exactly one matrix family by `(provider, model)`, require its effort to appear in that row's Selectable efforts cell, and collect the effort. `inherit-parent` and `auto` rows carry no family effort.

An unmatched provider/model, out-of-domain effort, or duplicate role is inconsistent state. Stop, show the conflicting rows verbatim, and ask for an explicit matrix family or alias replacement. If one or more families have mixed efforts, show every conflicting family and role row, then ask for one normalized effort per family from its Selectable efforts cell. Do not invent a precedence rule. Do not probe or write while any inconsistency is unresolved.

One distinct effort per family is the current value. A family with no non-alias occurrence is unassigned: do not ask for its effort, check its CLI, or probe it. A family that a step 2 role change newly assigns takes its matrix Default effort as the proposed value.

### 4. Collect one requested effort per family

Ask one effort question for each assigned family. Name each model, its current or proposed value, and the Selectable efforts from its matrix row. Empty input keeps that value. On a first run, state the assigned families' matrix defaults before asking. On a rerun, state the parsed values without offering to reset customized role lanes.

### 5. Probe the requested pairs

Before any external CLI availability/authentication check or model probe, resolve the selected families through this parent's route table. On a Codex parent, name the assigned external families (Claude Fable, Claude Opus, and/or Grok) and inspect the parent's effective permission instructions for network access and the actual credential/state paths those CLIs need, including any required outside-workspace writes. Do not inspect credential contents or attempt a denied write to establish permission. `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED=1` in the parent's own environment is evidence that external CLI network access is disabled; inspect it before child-environment scrubbing. `CODEX_SANDBOX` identifies a sandbox backend, not a complete permission policy. Missing markers, a config-file preference, or the name `workspace-write` alone do not prove sufficient access. Use the effective session permissions and required paths, not a blanket ban on every path outside the workspace.

If required access is blocked, explain the affected assigned families and the restriction before invoking their CLIs. If permission information is unavailable or incomplete, call it **unknown**, say which required access cannot be established, and resolve it before external checks or probes. Offer exactly two paths when access is blocked or remains unknown:

1. Restart the parent with suitable permissions, chosen deliberately by the operator; stop this setup without writing. See provider-dispatch's **Host and parent prerequisites**, including Grok's nested-sandbox limitation.
2. Explicitly choose native-only role assignments for this parent. Show each affected role and proposed replacement and obtain the operator's named changes, then return to steps 2–4 to validate the revised map and efforts before native probes. On Codex, Sol is native; `inherit-parent` and `auto` also stay native. Do not change any lane automatically, reduce its effort, or launch an external CLI for a now-unassigned family. State any reduction in provider diversity.

If all chosen families are native, no external CLI permission check or probe is needed; the separate final-write check still applies. When the effective permissions allow the selected external lanes, proceed with the existing routes and requested efforts unchanged. Never change sandbox settings or escalate permissions as part of setup.

Probe only the selected `provider:model@effort` pair of each assigned family. Run one probe per family in the role map, even when two families share a provider. Do not enumerate or offer older models as substitutes. A failed probe writes nothing: report the failing pair and provider, stop, and keep the active sheet plus parent integration bytes unchanged. A failed first run creates neither artifact.

If a Grok probe fails because the host cannot enforce its bounded sandbox, see [Host and parent prerequisites](../poteto-mode/references/provider-dispatch.md#host-and-parent-prerequisites); keep the active configuration unchanged.

| Family | Pair source | Claude parent route | Codex parent route | Availability proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fable | Fable matrix row + selected effort | native Agent `pstack-fable-<effort>` | Claude CLI | native one-turn probe or `claude auth status --json` plus one-turn probe |
| Sol | Sol matrix row + selected effort | `codex exec` | native `spawn_agent` | `codex login status` plus one-turn probe or native one-turn probe |
| Grok | Grok matrix row + selected effort | Grok CLI | Grok CLI | `grok models` must list the requested model; one-turn probe |
| Opus | Opus matrix row + selected effort | native Agent `pstack-opus-<effort>` | Claude CLI | native one-turn probe or `claude auth status --json` plus one-turn probe |

A family whose matrix row names the `cursor` provider probes through the external runner with `cursor-agent`, and its availability proof is `cursor-agent models` listing the requested slug plus a one-turn probe. Cursor has no effort flag, so that family's Selectable efforts cell holds only the effort its slug names; changing its effort means changing the matrix row's Model cell, not the descriptor alone. A family whose matrix row names the `kimi` provider probes through the external runner with `kimi`, and its availability proof is `kimi provider list --json` listing the alias with the selected effort, plus a one-turn probe. That family's Selectable efforts cell holds only the efforts the listing reports for its alias. On a Codex parent, the access check above covers Cursor and Kimi families too: both CLIs need network access, and Kimi's Seatbelt profile cannot start inside Codex's sandbox, so a Kimi family needs the same unsandboxed parent as Grok.

Use a tiny read-only probe that returns a unique marker. A login-status command alone proves credentials, not that the requested model and effort flags run. Record native and external results separately. Never call the external launcher for the parent's own provider. On a Claude parent, the Fable and Opus probes are one-turn runs of the mapped `pstack-<stem>-<effort>` agent. On a Codex parent, the Sol probe is native `spawn_agent` with the selected `reasoning_effort`. Every other pair uses the external runner with the selected effort flag.

Receipts and native transcripts prove the requested effort and the route. They do not prove a provider's hidden applied reasoning depth. There is no implicit timeout, weaker-model fallback, same-provider external fallback, or second mutable configuration source.

### 6. Render, preserving role families

Build the new sheet in memory. Do not write it yet.

- First run: start from the complete role assignments in step 7, with the step 2 role changes applied.
- Rerun: start from the normalized complete role map from step 2, with the step 2 role changes applied, preserving each loaded row's lane order and family (or alias) per lane.

Rewrite every matrix-family descriptor to `provider:model@<requested effort for that family>`. Leave `inherit-parent` and `auto` unchanged. An effort-only rerun cannot change a role's family. Changing Grok's effort updates every Grok occurrence and does not move a Sol role onto Grok. Refuse an unqualified slug, an unavailable route, a model outside the model matrix, or a provider/model mismatch.

### 7. Confirm and commit

Show any rolling-alias migrations as original and normalized descriptors and any retired-role rows dropped in step 2. Then show the route table for this parent and every rendered role and descriptor. Ask for confirmation before writing.

Why and Reflect require the parent's live MCP surface. Keep their investigator, reviewer, and synthesizer roles on `inherit-parent` or `auto`; the bounded external runner deliberately omits ambient MCPs. `inherit-parent` and `auto` always validate, but say when they reduce a panel's provider diversity. For panel roles, one lane runs per entry. The list length is the fan-out count. `arena cross-judge pool` is a list from which Arena chooses a provider different from the parent and base candidate when possible. `swarm workers` is the default for every worker unless a race explicitly assigns another descriptor.

Every non-alias value must match `<provider>:<model>@<effort>` and must have passed step 5.

After the operator confirms, separately check the parent's effective write permission for **both actual destinations** (the sheet and parent integration, resolved through `CODEX_HOME` when set) and any directory creation needed. Render both artifacts in memory and perform this check before the first write or directory creation. Native probes succeeding does not grant configuration-write permission. A restricted parent may still be allowed to write under `CODEX_HOME`; assess each resolved destination rather than rejecting it just because it is outside the workspace. If either destination is denied or its permission remains unknown, stop with the destination-specific explanation: leave every existing artifact byte-identical and create neither artifact on a first run. Do not test permission by overwriting a target, write only the allowed artifact, or automatically request escalation.

Only after both destinations are permitted, write the in-memory render from step 6 using step 8's snapshot and readback procedure. Never paste the example below as the result. It is only the complete first-run role map used to seed step 2; selected efforts and explicit role changes always replace its example values before writing.

```markdown
# pstack model configuration

Provider-qualified per-role choices. Read the installed pstack provider-dispatch reference before dispatching a configured role. Every documented role remains present. `inherit-parent` and `auto` use the parent model natively and still count as one panel lane.

```

### 8. Wire it in

Render the parent integration in memory before either write. On Claude, the integration is the single `@~/.claude/pstack-models.md` include in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. On Codex, it is the exact sheet bytes between one `<!-- pstack:models:begin -->` and `<!-- pstack:models:end -->` pair in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. Replace that whole bounded block on a rerun. Insert one block at the end on first run. If either marker is missing, duplicated, or reversed, stop and report inconsistent state instead of guessing a boundary.

Snapshot every target's current bytes. Write the sheet and parent integration only after every requested pair passes and the operator confirms. Read both targets back and compare them with the in-memory render. If either write or readback fails, restore every snapshot and report the failure. An unchanged rerun must produce byte-identical sheet and integration content after normalization.

Do not copy the model sheet between harnesses without rerunning the parent-specific probes; route availability can differ even on the same host.

### 9. Behavioral smoke

Before declaring setup complete, run one small read-only mixed panel from this parent: every distinct chosen descriptor, distinct output/receipt paths, and an independent cross-judge. Launch Claude-native agents and every external process in the background with retained handles, then drain them. Verify the native transcript entries and every external receipt. A structural config check or unit test is not a substitute.

Report the sheet path, parent route table, requested-effort probe results, smoke results, and external elapsed/token/cost receipts. Re-running this skill re-probes and updates the same sheet. Do not claim the provider exposed hidden applied-effort observability.
